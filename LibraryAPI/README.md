This project is a simple RESTful API built using Python Flask and MySQL, designed to manage a collection of books. It supports full CRUD operations and communicates using JSON. The API is tested using Postman.

# Technologies Used

- Python (Flask)
- Flask SQLAlchemy
- MySQL
- Postman
- VS Code
- pip (for package management)


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd LibraryAPI
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create the MySQL Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE librarydb;
```

> Ensure your `config.py` file has the correct MySQL credentials and database name.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```
The server will start at: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
